This project is a simple full-stack Notes application that demonstrates how to build RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, handle CRUD operations, and persist data using a JSON file. It serves a static frontend and allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes seamlessly through API endpoints.

Setup & Tools

Node.js, Express basics, and project structure.

Backend Development

Creating the Express server.

Building REST API endpoints for CRUD operations.

Reading/writing JSON files for data storage.

Middleware usage (like express.json(), static files serving).

Frontend Basics

HTML/CSS basics for the UI.

JavaScript for interacting with the backend (fetch API).

Testing APIs

Using Postman to test each CRUD route.

Error Handling & Edge Cases

Handling missing data, invalid routes, empty file issues.

Running and Debugging

Starting the server, monitoring console logs, fixing common errors.
